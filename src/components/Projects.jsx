          <h2>The Stoic Path To Wealth</h2>

          <p>
            The Stoics understood that if you can control your reactions and manage your emotions, you can achieve success. The same principles apply to our financial lives today.

            The only way to beat inflation and grow your wealth is by investing. The greatest investors approach the markets with discipline, emotional distance, and self-masteryâ€”lessons that the Stoics have been teaching us for thousands of years.

          <h2>Days at the Morisaki Bookshop </h2>

          <p>
            Hidden in Jimbocho, Tokyo is a booklover's paradise. On a quiet corner in an old wooden building lies a shop filled with hundreds of second-hand books.

            Twenty-five-year-old Takako has never liked reading, although the Morisaki bookshop has been in her family for three generations. It is the pride and joy of her uncle Satoru, who has devoted his life to the bookshop since his wife Momoko left him five years earlier.
